# Tadaima CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Philosophy: Simple CI for Early Development

This project uses a **simplified CI approach** suitable for the early development phase, focusing on build validation and basic testing.

## Current Workflows

### 🚀 GitHub Actions CI (Build & Test Focus - 3-5 min)

**ci.yml** - Simple build and test pipeline:
- ✅ Install all workspace dependencies
- ✅ Run linting across all packages
- ✅ Run TypeScript type checking
- ✅ Build all applications
- ✅ Run test suites (Jest + Vitest)
- ✅ Test GraphQL server health endpoint

### 🏠 Local Development (Git Hooks)

**Pre-commit hooks** - Quality checks before commit:
- ✅ Code formatting and linting
- ✅ Security scanning with secrets detection
- ✅ Basic validation checks

## Removed Workflows (Early Development Phase)

These workflows were **removed** as they're not needed during initial development:

- ❌ `release.yml` - No releases until MVP complete
- ❌ `update-dependencies.yml` - Manual dependency management during active development
- ❌ Docker builds and deployment - Focus on development first
- ❌ Container security scanning - Premature for current phase
- ❌ CodeQL analysis - Will be added later for security

## Benefits

1. **Fast Development Cycles** - Quick feedback on basic build and test issues
2. **Reduced Complexity** - Single workflow focused on essential validation
3. **Cost Effective** - Minimal CI resource usage during development
4. **Developer Friendly** - Clear, simple pipeline that's easy to understand

## Workflow Triggers

- **CI**: Pull requests and pushes to main branch
- **Pre-commit**: Every commit (handled by git hooks)

## Development Workflow

```bash
# Developer makes changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: new feature"
# → Pre-commit hooks run - formatting, linting, security

git push
# → GitHub Actions CI runs - build, test, health check
```

## Future Enhancements

As the project matures, we'll add:
- Docker build and deployment workflows
- Automated releases with semantic versioning
- Container security scanning
- Dependency update automation
- CodeQL security analysis

This simplified approach ensures we focus on core development while maintaining code quality.
