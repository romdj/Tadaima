# Claude Code Session Log - Tadaima Project

## Session: Initial Codebase Analysis and CLAUDE.md Creation
**Date**: 2025-08-01
**Command**: `/init` - Analyze codebase and create CLAUDE.md

### Analysis Performed
1. **Package.json Analysis**: Examined root, frontend, and graphql-server package.json files
2. **Architecture Review**: Studied monorepo structure with npm workspaces
3. **Documentation Review**: Read README.md, roadmap.md, and existing project documentation
4. **Configuration Review**: Examined .env.example and environment setup
5. **Code Structure**: Analyzed key files including server.ts, GraphQL schema, and frontend layout

### Key Findings
- **Project Type**: European property search aggregator called "Tadaima"
- **Architecture**: Thin client approach with real-time API aggregation (no database)
- **Tech Stack**: 
  - Backend: Fastify + Mercurius GraphQL + TypeScript
  - Frontend: SvelteKit + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + DaisyUI
  - Testing: Jest (backend) + Vitest (frontend)
- **Structure**: npm workspaces with 3 packages (graphql-server, frontend, shared)
- **Purpose**: Aggregates property listings from 8+ European real estate portals

### Files Created/Modified
1. **CLAUDE.md** - Created comprehensive guidance file for future Claude Code instances
   - Included all key commands for development
   - Documented architecture and tech stack
   - Added development setup instructions
   - Listed supported property portals and integrations

### Files Analyzed
- `/package.json` - Root monorepo configuration
- `/frontend/package.json` - Frontend dependencies and scripts
- `/graphql-server/package.json` - Backend dependencies and scripts
- `/shared/package.json` - Shared configuration
- `/README.md` - Project documentation
- `/roadmap.md` - Project roadmap (minimal)
- `/.env.example` - Environment configuration template
- `/graphql-server/src/server.ts` - Main server setup
- `/graphql-server/src/graphql/schemas/schema.graphql` - GraphQL schema
- `/frontend/src/routes/+layout.svelte` - Frontend layout

### Session Notes
- Project appears to be in early development stages
- Comprehensive environment setup with multiple European API integrations
- Well-structured monorepo with proper workspace configuration
- Modern tech stack with full TypeScript coverage
- Focus on real-time aggregation without data persistence
